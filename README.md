- Download and load a code-focused instruct model in LM Studio.
- Open **Developer**, start the Local Server, and enable the OpenAI-compatible API on port `1234`.
- For semantic project search, also load an embedding model supported by LM Studio.

### 2️⃣ Installation
1. Visit the **[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FutureStackSolution.LocalPilotFSS)**.
2. Click **Download**, or search for "LocalPilot" within the Visual Studio Extension Manager:
   - *Extensions > Manage Extensions > Online*
3. Restart Visual Studio to complete the installation.

### 3️⃣ Configuration
Navigate to **Tools > Options > LocalPilot > Settings**.
1. **LM Studio Base URL**: Usually `http://localhost:1234/v1`. The `/v1` suffix is added automatically if omitted. Click **"Test Connection"** to verify.
2. **Model Assignments**: Assign preferred models for **Chat** and **Inline Completions**.

> [!TIP]
> For the best experience in **v1.9**, we recommend:
> - **Chat/Logic**: `qwen2.5-coder:7b` or `llama3.1:8b` (Excellent reasoning & tool use).
